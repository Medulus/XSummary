## Overview

The AI & Robotics Newsletter Generator automates the process of aggregating tweets from selected Twitter (X) accounts across the AI and robotics industry. It then leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT API (currently using the `gpt-4o-mini` model) to summarize these tweets into a coherent newsletter. Finally, it outputs the newsletter in both Markdown and PDF formats.

The project consists of two main scripts:

1. **twitter_data_stream.py**  
   Collects tweets from a predetermined list of accounts over the past 12 hours using Twitter API v2.

2. **csvtopdf.py**  
   Reads a CSV file (generated by the tweet collector), compiles the tweet content, sends the data to OpenAI for summarization, and then saves the resulting newsletter as both a Markdown file and a PDF.

---

## Features

- **Tweet Collection:**  
  Collects tweets from influencers, researchers, companies, and organizations in the AI/robotics space.

- **API Integration:**  
  Uses Twitter API (via Tweepy Client with bearer token) for collecting data and OpenAI API for generating newsletter content.

- **Newsletter Generation:**  
  Summarizes recent tweets into structured sections:
  - Introduction
  - Highlights
  - Key Insights
  - Conclusion

- **PDF Conversion:**  
  Generates a PDF version of the newsletter using the FPDF library.

- **Configurable & Modular:**  
  Easily update the list of Twitter accounts and adjust prompt parameters for OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.7+** installed.
- Twitter API credentials (bearer token) obtained via your [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/).
- An OpenAI API key from your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/).
- Basic knowledge of using the terminal/command prompt.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Install the dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tweepy openai pandas fpdf schedule configparser
   ```

   Alternatively, if you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

Create a configuration file named `config.ini` in the root directory of your project. A sample configuration file looks like:

```ini
[twitter]
bearer_token = YOUR_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN

[openai]
api_key = YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

## Usage

### 1. Collecting Tweets

Run the tweet collection script to gather tweets from your specified accounts. This script collects tweets published within the past 12 hours and stores them in a CSV file.

```bash
python twitter_data_stream.py
```

- **Note:**  
  The script creates a directory named `tweet_data` in your project folder and saves CSV files there with names like `tweets_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`.

### 2. Generating the Newsletter

Once you have a CSV file of collected tweets, generate your newsletter by running:

```bash
python csvtopdf.py
```

When prompted, input the path or name of the CSV file (e.g., `tweet_data/tweets_20230425123045.csv`).

The script will:
- Read and compile the tweet content from the CSV.
- Request OpenAI to summarize the tweets into a newsletter.
- Save the output as `newsletter.md` (Markdown) and `newsletter.pdf` (PDF).

## Troubleshooting & Limitations

- **OpenAI Rate Limit / Quota Exceeded:**  
  If you encounter a `RateLimitError` or quota issues, check your usage on the OpenAI dashboard. You might need to reduce the `max_tokens` value or upgrade your plan.

- **Twitter API Rate Limits:**  
  Ensure you are within your Twitter API usage limits. The script includes basic rate-limiting measures (batching, sleeps, exponential backoff in some versions), but you may need to fine-tune these delays based on your usage.

- **Model Deprecation:**  
  Make sure you're using an active OpenAI model (currently `gpt-4o-mini` is recommended). Update the model parameter in `csvtopdf.py` if necessary.

- **CSV Format:**  
  The CSV file must have the columns: `User`, `Tweet`, and `Created At` for the newsletter generator to function properly.
